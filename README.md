# react-hook-resizable-element

A React useEffect hook to allow resizing of elements based of some dependency.

Works with any HTMLElement that has the following attributes:

 - ele.scrollHeight (read)
 - ele.style.height (read/write)

 I wrote it specifically for teaxtarea, and checked it on `textarea` and `p` elements.
